# battery_plot

Simple CLI-Tool to show your batteryusage over time.

## Execution

To start *monitoring*:


  bash deamon.sh


To show the *graph*:


  gcc -o bat_plot batteryplot.c
  ./bat_plot



*NOTICE* that it will take some time until the plot is visible since data is collected only once every 5 minutes. At first your plot will be empty.
