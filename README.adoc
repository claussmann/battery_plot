# battery_plot

Simple CLI-Tool to show your batteryusage over time.

## Install

  make install
  


## Execution

To start *monitoring*:


  ~/.batteryusage/deamon.sh


Alternatively you can add a cronjob to run it on startup:

  crontab -e
  #Append:
  */3 * * * *   /home/YOUR_USER/.batteryusage/deamon-cron.sh

To show the *graph*:


  ~/.batteryusage/batteryusage-plot



IMPORTANT: It will take some time until the plot is visible since data is collected only once every 3 minutes. At first your plot will be empty.
